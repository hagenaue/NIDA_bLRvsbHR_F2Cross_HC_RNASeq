# NIDA_bLRvsbHR_F2Cross_HC_RNASeq
Code used to analyze the hippocampal RNA-Seq data derived from an experiment cross-breeding the selectively-bred bHR and bLR lines (F0) to produce F1 and F2 cross progeny. 
This code was used for the publication: "Bioenergetic-related gene expression in the hippocampus predicts internalizing vs. externalizing behavior in an animal model of temperament" by Hebda-Bauer, Hagenauer et al. 2025:

##F0: 
This code was used to analyze the hippocampal RNA-Seq data from male and female selectively-bred bHR rats and bLR rats:

##F2:
This code was used to analyze the hippocampal RNA-Seq data from the F2 cross progeny (males and females):
