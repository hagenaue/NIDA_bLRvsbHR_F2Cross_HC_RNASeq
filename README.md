# NIDA_bLRvsbHR_F2Cross_HC_RNASeq
Code used to analyze the hippocampal RNA-Seq data derived from an experiment cross-breeding the selectively-bred bHR and bLR lines (F0) to produce F1 and F2 cross progeny. 
This code was used for the publication: "Bioenergetic-related gene expression in the hippocampus predicts internalizing vs. externalizing behavior in an animal model of temperament" by Hebda-Bauer, Hagenauer et al. 2025:

## Folder F0: 
This code was used to analyze the hippocampal RNA-Seq data from male and female selectively-bred bHR rats and bLR rats:
Gene Expression Omnibus Dataset ID: GSE225744
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE225744

## Folder F2:
This code was used to analyze the hippocampal RNA-Seq data from the F2 cross progeny (males and females):
Gene Expression Omnibus Dataset ID: GSE225746
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE225746

## Folder NON_HC: https://github.com/hagenaue/NIDA_bLRvsbHR_F2Cross_HC_RNASeq/tree/main/NON_HC
This code was used to analyze microarray data from bHR/bLR rats from both public sources and a newly released data profiling non-hippocampal brain tissue (amygdala, cortex, hypothalamus, dorsal raphe):
Gene Expression Omnibus Dataset ID for the newly-released data: GSE286181
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE286181
Gene Expression Omnibus Dataset IDs for the public datasets: GSE88874, GSE86893
